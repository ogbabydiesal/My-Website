      <p>Hello, welcome to my website.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>I'm a New York City based artist working mostly through music and code. My projects often begin with a technological or psychoacoustic curiosity. I'm interested in algorithmic approaches to sound composition, simulations, and manifestations of identity, tradition and history in electronic culture.</p>
